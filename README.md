# WebOfDocuments
When taking notes for any topic, keeping them in 1 document is unwieldy, and keeping them in multiple documents is often difficult to keep track of. WOD proposes the solution of many interlinked documents.

Txt files

Clickable links between different txt files

Viewable web of documents

Graph representation (points with variable number of edges)

Multiple “root” documents

Documents do not require connections to other documents

In-app tabs?

Embedding image?

If an example is needed to help visualize it. Look up Obsidian, its a desktop app that I’m hoping to recreate on the web.

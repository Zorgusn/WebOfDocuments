# WebOfDocuments
When taking notes for any topic, keeping them in 1 document is unwieldy, and keeping them in multiple documents is often difficult to keep track of. WOD proposes the solution of many interlinked documents

If an example is needed to help visualize it. Look up Obsidian, its a desktop app that Iâ€™m hoping to recreate on the web.

Current Minimal Plan:

User is able to create markdown documents.

User is able to use markdown syntax within documents.

User is able to add links within text documents; special form for only going to another document on the site?
